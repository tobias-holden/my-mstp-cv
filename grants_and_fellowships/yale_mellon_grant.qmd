The Trumbull College Mellon Forum provides seniors who are doing senior projects or writing senior essays with opportunities to share their work with each other in an intellectually stimulating and congenial setting. It is competitive to get into the Forum, but those accepted tend to really appreciate the experience!

A limited number of Mellon Forum Research Grants are available for Trumbull undergraduates to pursue research during the academic year under the supervision of a member of the Yale faculty. If awarded a grant, you are required to report on the results of your research either to the Mellon Senior Forum or to another educational forum in the College. In addition, you must submit to the Trumbull Office a written report on the work made possible by the grant by April.
