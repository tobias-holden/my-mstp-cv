The goal of my project was to induce trophoblast stem cells from somatic cells, and I spent 9 weeks in the lab designing cloning constructs to use in mice. I identified 5 candidate reprogramming genes and constructed plasmids for transformation into E. Coli, to eventually be carried by lentivirus.\nI continued working with Dr. Mak after the fellowship ended, aiding in data collection and analysis for a project studying the role of a particular translational regulator (Pumilio-1) in the development of primordial follicles in mammalian ovaries.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Obesity is a major risk factor for several cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Non-Hispanic black and Hispanic women are substantially more likely to be obese than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. Thus, identifying effective strategies for reducing obesity is critical to alleviate disparities in obesity and related adverse cardiopulmonary and sleep outcomes facing black and Hispanic women in the U.S. An agent-based model of a food-choice environment was built using in Python. Agents modeled were individuals with unique dietary preferences and eating establishments of varied price and healthfulness. Early simulations were able to reproduce disparities in diet quality between low- and high-income households observed in previous food-choice models when individual food choices were weighted according to preliminary data on meal preferences. Future work will involve updating the model to represent different Chicagoland community areas, and to include a physiological representation of weight gain/loss related to meal choices. Ultimately, a robust agent-based model can be used to simulate public health interventions aimed at reducing obesity by modifying diet behaviors or regulating eating establishments."

    "text": "In 2021, Dr. Gerardin and I began a collaboration with Dr. Linda Amoah at the University of Ghana in Accra to create a simulation model of a clinical trial her team led in two villages within the Greater Accra area. The trial assessed the relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of standard vs. ultrasensitive rapid diagnostic tests for P. falciparum malaria under a mass testing, treatment, and tracking (MTTT) strategy.\n\nTo simulate the trial, I built a spatial model of the study villages, with transmission intensity calibrated to achieve observed malaria incidence and prevalence at the start and end of the trial, and modeled RDTs based off their performance relative to gold standard PCR in the trial.\n\nBy incorporating human movement into the model, I found that anomalous mass migration in 2020 could have diminished the effect size of MTTT interventions in the study by 50-60%."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Malaria continues to be a major global health concern and is responsible for more than 400,000 deaths annually with more than 90% in Sub-Saharan Africa. Symptoms of malaria are caused by asexual parasites, but malaria is passed from humans to mosquitoes by sexually-differentiated gametocytes. After repeat exposures, acquired immunity limits the density of asexual parasites and the likelihood of developing symptoms. One possible barrier to malaria elimination is the reservoir of chronic infections with asexual parasite densities too low to prompt treatment, but sufficient gametocytes to infect mosquitoes. Therefore, detecting and treating asymptomatic infections could reduce transmission and indirectly prevent deaths.\nPreliminary results from a clinical trial in Burkina Faso (the INDIE trial) suggest that regular screening, testing, and treatment (STT) interventions significantly reduce gametocyte density and infectivity to mosquitoes. However, the effect of STT on reducing transmission and preventing cases and deaths at the population level remains unknown. I propose to use agent-based modeling to predict the impact of STT if it were to be widely implemented as part of malaria control or elimination efforts.\n\nFirst, I will use data from INDIE to build a detailed spatial model of the study site, calibrate within-host relationships between parasites, gametocytes, and infectivity, and validate the effect of STT on gametocyte density and infectivity.\nNext, I will predict the impact of implementing universal STT for the entire INDIE study area on reducing malaria cases.\n\nSince STT is resource-intensive, I will compare the effectiveness of implementing targeted STT in the INDIE study area, considering targeting by age group, limiting STT to the wet or dry season, and targeting STT to households with the highest mosquito exposure.\nUsing an archetypes approach and without considering other malaria interventions, I will make a back-of-the-envelope prediction of the impact of universal and targeted STT across all malaria-endemic Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nFinally, I will adapt existing models contextualized by intervention history to assess the impact and cost- effectiveness of targeted STT strategies in high-burden and near-elimination settings, compared to established interventions.\n\nThe results of the proposed research will help policymakers decide if, when, and how to deploy STT to combat malaria. The F31 Ruth L. Kirschstein NRSA Individual Predoctoral Fellowship award will allow me to build my quantitative and research skills, improve my scientific writing and communication, and gain expertise in infectious disease epidemiology on the path toward becoming a successful independent investigator. In conducting the proposed research, I will integrate into a global network of malaria modelers and epidemiologists, gain familiarity with agent-based modeling, and make scientific contributions to the assessment of STT as a tool for malaria control and elimination.

We used the model system of E. coli to observe the relationship between variation in the population distribution of individual swimming phenotypes and the speed of collective migration for groups of bacteria. I cultured bacteria and recorded both collective and single-cell swimming patterns, which were then used to adjust a computational model of bacterial chemotaxis in MATLAB."

The laboratory employed mathematical models and computational simulations to quantitatively understand the molecular mechanisms behind cardiac physiology. One area of interest was improving prediction of arrhythmogenic risk in drug safety screening, where overestimation of risk shelves potentially therapeutic drugs, but underestimation can be lethal.\nI optimized existing mathematical models to capture the special electrophysiology of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs). Generating a working model of patient-derived hiPS-CMs would be a promising step toward personalized arrhythmia risk-assessment, the goal of the FDA’s Comprehensive In Vitro Proarrhythmia Assay initiative.\n\nI compared the in silico behavior of the established hiPS-CM model with in vitro patch-clamp data. I modified the model to include temperature sensitive effects on ion channel kinetics and to accommodate slower pacing. The updated model more accurately predicted the effects of test drugs on cell action potentials and ion handling.\nI built a prototype application using RShiny to make it much easier to customize parameters, run simulations, compute metrics, and visualize results, all in one place. The application improved reproducibility and provided a platform through which collaborators could more effectively make use of each other’s data and findings."

    "text": "In 2015 Intel announced it would provide $1.5M in funding over five years to increase the diversity of students pursuing graduate degrees in data science and computational science. The ACM SIGHPC/Intel Computational and Data Science Fellowships were the result of Intel’s commitment to this community. Specifically targeted at women or students from racial/ethnic backgrounds that have not traditionally participated in the computing field, the program was open to students pursuing degrees at institutions anywhere in the world. The fellowships are highly competitive, and are awarded after a rigorous merit review. The fellowship program, previously funded by Intel, is now funded exclusively by SIGHPC. I was named one of eleven fellowship recipients for 2022.\nThe program is intended to increase the diversity of students pursuing graduate degrees in data science and computational science, including women as well as students from racial/ethnic backgrounds that have been historically underrepresented in the computing field. The fellowship provides $15,000 annually for study anywhere in the world.\nStudents were nominated by their graduate advisors. Nominees spanned disciplines from biomedical engineering and computer science to quantum chemistry and geophysics, and represented large, mid-sized, and small institutions in countries around the world. More than 90% of nominees were female, and 45% were identified as an underrepresented minority in their country of study.\nThe nominations were evaluated and ranked by a panel of experts (who were themselves diverse with respect to race, gender, discipline, and nationality) based on nominees’ overall potential for excellence in data science and/or computational science, and the extent to which they will serve as leaders and role models to increase diversity in the workplace."

    "text": "The Trumbull College Mellon Forum provides seniors who are doing senior projects or writing senior essays with opportunities to share their work with each other in an intellectually stimulating and congenial setting. It is competitive to get into the Forum, but those accepted tend to really appreciate the experience!\nA limited number of Mellon Forum Research Grants are available for Trumbull undergraduates to pursue research during the academic year under the supervision of a member of the Yale faculty. If awarded a grant, you are required to report on the results of your research either to the Mellon Senior Forum or to another educational forum in the College. In addition, you must submit to the Trumbull Office a written report on the work made possible by the grant by April."
