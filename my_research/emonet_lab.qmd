In my senior year of college, I started a new project in Dr. Thierry Emonetâ€™s lab on the role of non-genetic heterogeneity in collective behavior.  We used the model system of *E. coli* to observe the relationship between variation in the population distribution of individual swimming phenotypes and the speed of collective migration for groups of bacteria. I cultured bacteria and recorded both collective and single-cell swimming patterns, which were then used to adjust a computational model of bacterial chemotaxis in MATLAB.
