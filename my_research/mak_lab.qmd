In 2015, I was awarded a Yale Science Technology and Research Scholars (STARS) summer fellowship to work with physician-scientist Dr. Winifred Mak at the Yale Stem Cell Center. The goal of my project was to induce trophoblast stem cells from somatic cells, and I spent 9 weeks in the lab designing cloning constructs to use in mice. I identified 5 candidate reprogramming genes and constructed plasmids for transformation into *E. Coli*, to eventually be carried by lentivirus.

I continued working with Dr. Mak after the fellowship ended, aiding in data collection and analysis for a project studying the role of a particular translational regulator (Pumilio-1) in the development of primordial follicles in mammalian ovaries. We found that Pumilio-1, but not its homolog Pumilio-2, functions as an important translational regulator in development of the female germline.
