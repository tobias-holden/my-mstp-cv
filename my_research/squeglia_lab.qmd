From 2018 to 2019, I worked at the Medical University of South Carolina in the Addiction Sciences Division with Dr. Lindsay Squeglia PhD and Dr. Kevin Gray MD on the [Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study](), a nationwide longitudinal study. I was responsible for conducting the study protocol with 9- to 11-year-old participants, including:

-   Recording structural and functional MRI images
-   Collecting biospecimen samples
-   Running toxicology assays
-   Administering neurocognitive assessments, environmental questionanaires, and mental health screenings
