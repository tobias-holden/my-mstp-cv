In 2020-21, Dr. Jaline Gerardin's team was a member of the Illinois COVID-19 Modeling Task Force, which contributed analyses and forecasts to Illinois and Chicago to support public health response.

-   I led analyses of racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 in Illinois, beginning during my rotation in Dr. Gerardin's lab in May 2020 and continuing on a part-time basis while I completed my second year of medical school.
-   I co-led work on characterizing heterogeneity in diagnostic testing, and I contributed to parameterizing a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission that was used for weekly forecasting.
-   I represented our modeling team in bi-weekly meetings of the Illinois Department of Public Health's Data Equity Working Group.

My work has been used to inform the direction of mobile testing units to underserved communities in Illinois and will continue to be used to probe drivers of disparities in COVID-19 exposure and mortality.
